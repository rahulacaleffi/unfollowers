# How it works
Our website simply works using coding "text comparison" between two fields, with the language selected.
Does not exist database during this method. The only database is from WordPress CMS.

# How it works - DETAILED (in 8 steps)
1. The main functionality is contained in just one page using HTML + PHP without database.
2. First, that page have a video explaining how to operate both input fields and language selector for the users convenience.
3. Right below, this language selector mentioned is <b>necessary</b> to understand what's the language of your browser, and eventually (and most common) of your instagram as well.
4. When you copy and paste your followers, for example, you can notice some phrase like "XXXXXXXXXX's profile picture".
5. That way, combining your language selected and our predefined sentences, we are able to separate what is the "XXXXXXXXXX" username from "'s profile picture" common sentence in several languages.
6. And like that we can have a list of all usernames of your input without duplicating.
7. Now we make the comparison between the usernames from the list 1 (input 1 - followers) and from the list 2 (input 2 - following).
8. Then you have a fulfilled table of who doesn't follow you back.
9. Due to copy and paste process, you aren't able to do it on mobile app or devices (more difficult).
